            <br></br>
           <p> In the case of eye donation. Call the central eye bank number or that of an eye bank near where you live and they will come and take the corneas with the least amount of hassle for the family. The whole process takes 5-10 minutes. If you do take the trouble to donate eyes, youâ€™ll be proud to know that two people who suffer from corneal blindness will be now able to see, thanks to your generous donation. </p>
           <h5> These are some important things to take care of in order to make a successful eye donation after death. </h5>
