         The primary legislation related to organ donation and transplantation in India,
Transplantation of Human Organs Act, was passed in 1994 and is aimed at
regulation of removal, storage and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic
purposes and for prevention of commercial dealings in human organs.

<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>
In India, matters related to health are governed by each state. The Act was initiated
at the request of Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh and Goa (who therefore adopted it
by default) and was subsequently adopted by all states except Andhra Pradesh and
Jammu &Kashmir. Despite a regulatory framework, cases of commercial dealings in
human organs were reported in the media. An amendment to the act was proposed
by the states of Goa, Himachal Pradesh and West Bengal in 2009 to address
inadequacies in the efficacy, relevance and impact of the Act. The amendment to the
Act was passed by the parliament in 2011, and the rules were notified in 2014. The
same is adopted by the proposing states and union territories by default and may be
adopted by other states by passing a resolution.</p>
<br></br>

are as follows:</h5>
<ul>
