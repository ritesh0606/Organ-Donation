           <h2><b>Pre-­transplant Recipient Evaluation and Preparation</b></h2>
           
           <br></br>
           <p > Although heart transplants are an established treatment for end stage heart failure, it is not suitable for everyone, so every potential heart transplant patient must be carefully assessed by the heart transplant team. While there are many people with end-stage heart disease with inadequate function of the heart, not all qualify for a heart transplant.</p>

           <p>During the assessment you will have several tests and be interviewed by various team members to determine whether transplantation is the best treatment option for you. They will also look into whether you are in a condition to undergo the transplant. All the other important organs in the body must be in pretty good shape. Transplants cannot be performed in patients with active infection, cancer, or bad diabetes mellitus; patients who smoke or abuse alcohol are also not good candidates. It’s not easy to be a transplant recipient. These patients need to change their lifestyle and take numerous medications.</p>

           <p>The transplant team will also try and identify social and behavioral factors that could interfere with recovery, compliance with medications, and lifestyle changes required after transplantation.</p>
           
           <p>Once recipient evaluation is completed, and the patient is found medically fit for transplant and ready to opt for it, the prescribed forms have to be completed and submitted through the hospital to the state-wide appropriate authority to register the patient’s name on the waiting list for a deceased donor transplant. After listing, patients should undergo periodic testing and review with the transplant team, and inform them of any significant changes in the patient’s medical condition. When a potential deceased donor heart is available, patients are alerted immediately and called to the hospital.</p>

           <h2><b>Organ Donors – Heart Transplant & Organ Donation</b></h2>
           <br>
           </br>
            <p>Donor hearts usually come from people who have injured their brain in an accident or who have had a major stroke. These patients are always on life-support machines in an intensive care unit and undergo a series of tests to see if their brain is still functioning. If there is no function of the brain, it is called “brain death”. This means that although the heart is still beating with the help of drugs and machines, there is no chance that they will wake up. If the machines and drugs are stopped the heart would stop beating. This is quite different from a “coma” where a patient can wake up.</p>

            <p>When someone is pronounced “brain dead”, the family of the person is approached to give their permission. When permission is obtained, the process of organ donation starts.</p>

            <p> Heart transplants are done soon after brain death of the donor is determined. Machines keep the heart and other organs functioning until the transplant teams arrive. The team needs to move quickly in order to obtain the heart in the best possible condition; Therefore, you will only receive a few hours’ notice of your transplant.</p>

            <h3><b> What happens during a heart transplant procedure? </b></h3><br></br>
             
            <p> Believe it or not, heart transplantation is a relatively simple operation for a cardiac surgeon. In fact, the procedure actually consists of three operations.</p>
            
           <p> The first operation is harvesting the heart from the donor. The donor is usually a person who has suffered irreversible brain injury, leading to “brain death”. Very often these are patients who have had major trauma to the head, for example, in an automobile accident. The victim’s organs, other than the brain, are working well with the help of medications and other “life support” that may include a respirator or other devices.</p>

           <p> The second operation is removing the recipient’s damaged heart. Removing the damaged heart may be very easy or very difficult, depending on whether the recipient has had previous heart surgery (as is often the case). If there has been previous surgery, cutting through the scar tissue may prolong and complicate removal of the heart. </p>
          
          <p> The third operation is probably the easiest; the implantation of the donor heart. Today, this operation basically involves the creation of only five lines of stitches, or “anastomoses”. These suture lines connect the large blood vessels entering and leaving the heart. Remarkably, if there are no complications, most patients who have had a heart transplant are home about one week after the surgery.</p>

          <h4><b> Common Diseases That May Lead to Transplantation</b></h4>
<br></br>
          <p> <ul>
                 <li> Coronary heart disease, also commonly called coronary artery disease is a narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, the arteries that provide the heart muscle with blood </li>
                 <li> Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) i.e. End-stage heart failure is a disease in which the heart muscle is failing severely in its attempt to pump blood through the body, and in which all other available treatments are no longer helping to improve the heart’s function. </li>
                 <li> (Cardiomayopathy) Unlike heart disease due to heart attacks, where there is a problem with adequate blood flow to the heart, cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle itself. </li>
