           <p>Once the need for a transplant is perceived, patients undergo a formal evaluation which involves blood tests, CT and other scans, tests for heart, lungs and other organ systems and assessment by various specialists. Evaluation is performed with the following goals:</p>
          
           <p> <ul>
                 <li> To establish the diagnosis and find the cause of Kidney disease. </li>
                 <li> To determine the severity of kidney disease and its effect on other organ such as liver, lungs, etc and thus determine urgency of transplant. </li>
                 <li> To actively look for cancer. </li>
                 <li> To evaluate the condition of other organ systems such as heart, lungs, liver, etc and determine patients ability to tolerate this major operation. </li>
                 <li> To evaluate difficulty, technical feasibility and risk of surgery.</li>

           <p> <h3> Donor (Live Transplant) </h3> </p>

           <p> The operation to remove a kidney is a major operation that requires a general anaesthetic. This means that the donor will be asleep during the operation, which usually takes about two to three hours. </p>

           <p> Traditionally, surgeons used a technique called “open nephrectomy” to remove a kidney. This involves the surgeon making an incision (15–20 cm long) in the side of the abdomen to remove the kidney. This operation is still used by many surgeons. </p>

           <p> A kidney can also be removed using “keyhole” or laparoscopic surgical techniques. This type of surgery is becoming more common. It involves a number of small incisions (1–3 cm each), through which instruments are inserted to remove the kidney. A larger incision is then made to take the kidney out. Keyhole surgery may take longer to perform than open nephrectomy, but the recovery time is quicker because the incisions are smaller. </p>

          <p> Once the kidney is removed it is taken to the recipient. After the operation is completed, the donor is taken to a recovery room where he or she will wake up from the anaesthetic. He or she will have several temporary tubes or lines inserted during the operation, which may include a tube inserted into the bladder (catheter) and a drainage tube from the wound. These tubes are usually removed within a few days. Drugs for pain relief will be given immediately, and these are gradually reduced as the person recovers from the operation.</p>

          <h3> Recipient </h3>
          <p> There are a number of different methods that can be used to carry out a kidney transplant. The most widely used method is known as a Gibson Incision.</p>
          <p> A Gibson Incision involves a three-stage procedure as detailed below.</p>
          <p> Firstly, an incision (cut) is made in lower abdomen, through which the donated kidney is put into place. Your own kidneys can usually be left where they are, unless they are causing a problem, such as an infection. </p>
          
          <p> Secondly, blood vessels from your lower abdomen are attached to the blood vessels of the donated kidney to provide the donated kidney with the blood supply that it needs to function properly.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, the ureter (the tube which carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) of the donated kidney is connected to your bladder.</p>

          <p>While the above procedure may sound relatively straightforward, it is demanding and complex surgery that usually takes three to four hours to complete.</p>
