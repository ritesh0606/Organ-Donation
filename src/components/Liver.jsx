           <br></br>
           <p> Some patients might have an irreversible liver disease, but not enough to warrant a transplant, whereas others might be too ill to benefit from a transplant. This assessment can be best made by doctors who specialize in liver diseases i.e. liver transplant surgeons and Hepatologists.
           </p>
           
           <p>Signs and symptoms of liver disease, and results of some blood tests are commonly used to determine severity of liver disease, which, in turn, determine the treatment required. There are certain scoring systems that indicate the severity of the liver disease. These are the Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CTP) Score, CTP Class (A, B, or C) and Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Score, and PELD Score. A high score will mean an early transplant, and a low scoring patient may not require a transplant. Patients whose liver disease is affecting other organ systems such as kidney, lungs and brain, may also need an early transplant.
          </p>

          <p>Patients with liver cancer are often diagnosed through routine screening tests such as ultrasound, CT scan or MRI. They might require an early transplant despite not suffering a severe underlying liver disease.
            </p>

          <p>Transplantation will not be offered to patients with current alcohol abuse problems, those with uncontrolled active infections, widespread cancer or severe, untreatable disease of the brain, heart or lungs.

          <h3> <strong> Who can be a living liver donor? </strong> </h3>
          <br>
          </br>
          
          <p> A living donor for liver transplant is a close family member defined as a ‘near relative’ in the THO Act. . This is defined as spouse, parents, siblings, grandparents, and children of the recipient. Any of these can be a donor as long as they are healthy and pass all their tests and fulfil the requirements of the law.

            </p>
            <ul> 
               <li> Compatible blood group with the recipient ( refer table below)</li>
                <li> A family member (wife, husband, mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter, grandfather, grandmother, grandson, granddaughter) or close relative of the patient. </li>
                <li> Family friends, well-wishers, staff or neighbours are not accepted as donors</li>
                <li> Age group 18-55 years</li>
                <li> Not overweight, because people who are overweight may have fatty liver</li>
                <li>The donor’s liver should be large enough to provide adequate volume for the recipient (patient) as well as for the donor </li>
                <li> Donor should be in good overall physical and mental health, undergo a thorough medical and psychological evaluation, fully understand the risks of surgery and only then volunteer for donation.</li>
