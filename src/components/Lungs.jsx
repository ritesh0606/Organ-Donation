           <h5 > Lungs Transplant</h5>
           <p>A lung transplant is a surgery to remove a person’s diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor.</p>
           <p> Lung transplants are used for people who are likely to die from lung disease within 1 to 2 years. Their conditions are so severe that other treatments, such as medicines or breathing devices, no longer work.</p>
           <p> If you are told that you need a lung transplant, whether you have been sick for only a short period of time or a long time, you may still find it hard to believe that this is happening to you. You may feel at a complete loss, and a feeling of despondency may come over you at the thought of a long drawn out course of treatment.</p>
           <p> But just remember that having a lung transplant can offer you a second chance at life and hope for the future. Life will be different after your transplant. You will have to make a lifetime commitment to taking care of your new lungs. This is not as frightening as it sounds. If you follow the instructions laid down for you by your doctors and take all your medications, there is every chance that you will make a complete recovery. Getting back to work, resuming your old activities, and being able to do many more activities with your new lungs are things you can look forward to once the transplant is done.</p>
            
               
               <h5 > Pre-­transplant Recipient Evaluation and Preparation</h5>
               <p>The purpose of the lung transplant evaluation is to determine whether you are a candidate for lung transplant. Your evaluation for a lung transplant will betailored depending on your diagnosis. Tests done during your evaluation may differ from tests done for another patient. Most patients will have an evaluation schedule similar to the one described below.</p>
               <p>Lung transplant evaluations are generally done on an outpatient basis. Plan to spend two or three nights near the hospital you go to. The evaluation is a busy time. Plan to bring a caregiver with you, as you will be tired at the end of the day and your caregiver needs to learn about the process as well.</p>
                
                <p>The evaluation usually begins early in the morning. During your evaluation you can expect to have the following tests:</p>
                
                <p> <ul>
                 <li>Pulmonary function tests </li>
                 <li> Cardiac catheterization </li>
                 <li> Chest X-ray </li>
                 <li> Bone density scan (QDR) </li>
                 <li> Echocardiogram </li>
                 <li> Lung perfusion scan </li>
                 <li> Blood draw </li> 

           </ul>
           </p>
                          
         </div>
           </section>
        </div>
